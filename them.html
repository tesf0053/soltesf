          <h3 class="display-5">1, Family Relationships. </h3>
          <p class="card-text">
            The central conflict in the play is between Willy and his son Biff. As a father, he saw a lot of promise in the athletic and womanizing Biff. After he dropped out of high school, however, father and son had a fallout, and Biff rejects the notions of American dream told by his father. Happy is more comfortoble with Willy’s way of life, but he is not the favorite child. The relationship between Willy, his father, and his brother Ben is explored as well. Willy’s father used to make and sell flutes, and for that purpose, he had his family travel all over the country. Ben, who made his fortune traveling, took after his father.</p>

            <h3 class="display-5"> 2, Gender relations</h3>
            <p class="card-text">Gender issues and relationships with the opposite gender is another major theme of the play. With the modernity and materialism plays important role in the society, the female seems to replace the patriarchy and become the head of the family. Willy Loman’s affair with the attractive anonymous woman of Boston and his son’s womanizing attitude both point to gender relationships in the  society. However, Linda does not fall victim to this modern thinking. Instead, she stays loyal to her husband.</p>

            <h3 class="display-5">3, Reality and illusions</h3>
            <p class="card-text">The play has presented another minor theme that is reality and illusions. Willy Loman dreams that he would succeed, or else his sons would do it in case of his failure. His dream of being wealthy and living in luxury is an illusion that he cannot see becoming a reality in his lifetime. In fact, he is unable to face the reality of his failure, his sons’ possible failure and going against his dream. Therefore, instead of accepting reality, he commits suicide.</p>


            <h3 class="display-5"> 4, Personality and success</h3>
            <p class="card-text">Developing a personality cult is another major theme of the play. Willy Loman constantly repeats and advises his sons that they must be liked by other. This is his pet word that he uses time and again to reflect a culture where a person well-liked becomes succssusful in business and industry. Therefore, business and market are based on the idea of the culture of personality. Miller has highlighted this belief of Willy Loman that image creates an economy and that people well-liked become financially successful.</p>
