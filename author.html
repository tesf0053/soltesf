          <p class="card-text">Arthur Asher Miller (October 17, 1915 – February 10, 2005) was an American playwright, essayist and screenwriter in the 20th-century American theater. Among his most popular plays are All My Sons (1947), Death of a Salesman (1949), The Crucible (1953), and A View from the Bridge (1955). He wrote several screenplays and was most noted for his work on The Misfits (1961). The drama Death of a Salesman is considered one of the best American plays of the 20th century.</p>

            <p class="card-text">
             Miller was born in Harlem, in the New York City borough of Manhattan, the second of three children of Augusta (Barnett) and Isidore Miller. He was Jewish and of Polish-Jewish descent. His father was born in Radomyśl Wielki, Galicia (then part of Austria-Hungary, now Poland), and his mother was a native of New York whose parents also arrived from that town. Isidore owned a women's clothing manufacturing business employing 400 people. He became a wealthy and respected man in the community.</p> <br>
             
            <h2>Early career</h2>
            <p class="card-text">
            In 1940, Miller married Mary Grace Slattery. The couple had two children, Jane (born September 7, 1944) and Robert (May 31, 1947 - March 6, 2022).Miller was exempted from military service during World War II because of a high school football injury to his left kneecap. In 1944 Miller's first play was produced; The Man Who Had All the Luck and won the Theatre Guild's National Award. The play closed after four performances with disastrous reviews.</p><br>
             
            <h2>Marriages and family </h2>
            <p class="card-text">
            Miller and Marilyn Monroe tie the knot in Westchester County, New York, 1956. In June 1956, Miller left his first wife, Mary Slattery, whom he married in 1940, and wed film star Marilyn Monroe. They met in 1951, had a brief affair, and remained in contact. Monroe had just turned 30 when they married; she never had a real family of her own and was eager to join the family of her new husband.
            Monroe began to reconsider her career and the fact that trying to manage it made her feel helpless. She admitted to Miller, "I hate Hollywood. I don't want it any more. I want to live quietly in the country and just be there when you need me. I can't fight for myself any more."</p>
