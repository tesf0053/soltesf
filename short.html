        <p class="card-text">At first moment's notice, Death of a Salesman is about the last day of the life of salesman Willy Loman, who has failed in his career at the age of 63. At home, he loses his sense of reality and switches to past events to interact with his mistress and brother Ben, which helps to explain why he ended up committing suicide. He also frequently conflicts with his oldest son Biff, who has been making a living as a drifter and the occasional thief since dropping out of high school. Happy, his younger son, is a womanizer and has an unimpressive career.
          In addition, the conflict between Biff and Willy is resolved in the play's climax after Biff explains how his father's view of the American Dream has failed them both. Willy decides to commit suicide so that his family can collect his life insurance.</p>
